Advanced driver monitoring utility.

Driver monitor is an advanced driver monitoring utility created first in 2010 by
hFireF0x (EP_XOFF) and myself. We kept it private for many years, as it still works
well today.

Given the last update to the code was in 2017, I see no reason as to why not to
make it open source for all.

It works on Windows 7 - Windows 10 version 10.0.19044.1766 (last version I tested on).
